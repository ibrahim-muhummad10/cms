00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.710
All right welcome back my students so now that you know how to use route's a little bit right.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.690
It's super easy just to go and create another row right.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.300
Let's just create one here.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.800
All right.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.240
Let's create a couple.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.600
All right.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:23.130
So let's say for example when you go to the contact page let's just do about unless she's returned some

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.550
tests.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.880
Of course you're not going to be returning to it you're going to be returning views later.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.570
But you know high about Ph.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.210
Right.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.470
And then they'd say something for contact

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.370
or something like that.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.760
Right.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.280
I am contact or whatever.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.980
It doesn't really matter and let's just go and visit those pages and see how we can do something they're

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.600
about to see that.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.590
So we know this already.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.960
All right.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.390
I'm going to show you how to pass parameters through view two views and two whatever you want inside

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.650
a closure function right here.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.260
All right.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.010
All right.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.340
So let's say for example you create and create another one real quick.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.150
Copy this.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.260
So let's just write it down because I want you to get used to writing so the route then they get mad

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.560
it like this.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.950
And then the first parameter would a single call for Slash to indicate that we want to go from route

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.040
.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.210
So whatever we put after this.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.110
So let's say for example we have a post but let's say it is puls number one and we want to see it.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.230
So we're going to put a forward slash and Dand the curly brackets and we can write whatever we want

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.320
.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.230
I just want this to be named ID.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.130
All right.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.380
So that's going to be the name of our variable that's going to be a variable.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.130
Right now is not a variable.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.370
This is the way is it tested in this function or this method.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.150
All right and then later on it will convert it to a variable.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.490
I'll show you right now how he does this.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.890
Well now he does this but where it is function then the curly brackets.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.330
And then I mean the parentheses and then the curly brackets and then bring it down.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.990
Here is what you catch a variable right here.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.080
All right.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.350
Now I can return it right here if I want to.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.050
So returned this is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.240
this is PPOs number whatever.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.680
I'm just going to concatenate the ID right there at the end.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.130
All right.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.440
So let's see how we can do this.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.570
We see this in the browser.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.000
So let's go.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.350
So we go to post the forward slash and then whatever number we want to.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.520
As you can see says polls number two polls number one thousand if I want to.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.990
So you can see how he passes that variable to this closure function right there.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.340
All right.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.770
So not only that but you can pass multiple variations of multiple parameters if I want to.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.820
So if I could if I put another parameter here let's say this is going to be the name.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:49.140
All I have to do is on the closure function put a coma here and put the name here and concatenated here

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.740
maybe with space or something and then put a variable there.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.160
All right.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.530
So I can go back to that put a force last year and put whatever name I want that one.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.930
That we go.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.240
So you can see you can pass multiple parameters

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.670
to that.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.200
And now later on what we're going to be doing is we're going to pass this parameter to views and any

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.990
other views we're going to be using them.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.910
All right.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.760
Very simple to do these guys.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.640
I mean it's not rocket science it's super easy.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.160
All right.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.040
So I want you to digest this information.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.850
All right.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.580
And that we're going to be exploring some more about routes and how we can use them with other things

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.080
in our application.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.200
Thank you so much for watching.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.320
I'll see you in the next lecture
